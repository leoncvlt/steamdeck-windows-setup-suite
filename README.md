# Steam Deck Windows Setup Suite

A set of scripts to streamline and optimize a (mostly) automated setup of a Windows 11 installation on Steam Deck.

### Usage
[Download the repository content](https://github.com/leoncvlt/steamdeck-windows-setup-suite/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unpack it and run the `steamdeck-windows-setup.bat` file - it will automatically start an elevated powershell window and run through the main script. The file might trigger Defender SmartScreen - in that case, just click "More info" and then "Run anyway".

### What it does

The script will start by showing a selection menu that can be navigated with the Steam Deck controller, and where each of the following operations can be toggled and selectively performed:

- Activate Windows, using the activation scripts at [https://massgrave.dev/](https://massgrave.dev/)
- Install any pending Windows updates
- Install the official [Valve Drivers for the Steam Deck](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6121-ECCD-D643-BAA8)
  - The APU driver being installed is the `2209130944` version, as the most recent one caused issues (error 1603) when installing on Windows 11 22H2.
  - Rather than the official Wireless driver, the unlocked version from [https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Windows-WiFi-Fix/](https://github.com/ryanrudolfoba/SteamDeck-Windows-WiFi-Fix/) is installed for better performance
- Install all Visual C++ Redistributables Runtimes, DirectX & .NET runtimes
- Install ayufan's [Steam Deck Tools](https://github.com/ayufan/steam-deck-tools) or Valkirie's [Handheld Companion](https://github.com/Valkirie/HandheldCompanion/releases) to enable performance overlays, native controller input, TDP & fan settings, and more
  - You should only install one of them, not both - the script will warn and stop you if you try to do so.
- Remove bloatware UWP Apps, see the [source list](data/bloat.json) for details
- Remove OneDrive
- Applies various QoL tweaks, see the [source file](libs/apply-tweaks.ps1) for details. Feel free to uncomment as you see fit.

 If you're running the script of a fresh Windows installation, I reccomend to run through all of them.

### Disclaimer
The script has been tested, but obviously I am not responsible if your Steam Deck explodes. As a general reccomendation, do not trust "Windows debloating" scripts from random internet people (like me!), but everything the script does should be pretty clear from reading the [source files](steamdeck-windows-setup.ps1).
